# DESCRIBE-roots
Complementary computational analysis of two novel polynitrogenated aromatic heterocycles detected in the project funded by PROMOSOL: DESCRIBE-DivErSity Chemotypic in Brassica napus. The first one conjugated to leucine M=321.107 and the second one to homophenylalanine M=369.107, both suspected as two pteridine-like conjugated amino acids and have previously been reported to be associated with clubroot resistance of Brassicaceae (Wagner et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erz265).
